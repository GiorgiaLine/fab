In the past compile and link has required different ordering when submodules
have been in play. This example does not demonstrate this but both orderings
are given here.

Compile

module_mod.o module_smod.o test.o

Link

module_smod.o module_mod.o test.o

The assumed reason for the difference is due to symbol resolution when linking.
Symbols have to be defined before they are referenced. Thus the submodule,
which defines the symbols must be linked before the module which uses them.

The reason why this is not apparent in this example is not clear. It may be
due to cases where this has been seen involving abstract classes.
