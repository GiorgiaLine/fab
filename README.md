# Fab - A Build System for Tomorrow!

The "Fab" build system aims to provide a quick and easy build process tailored towards a
specific subset of scientific software developers. Quick should be in both use and
operation. Easy should mean the simple things are simple and the complicated things
possible.

The tool is not intended for general use outside its intended domain although you are,
of course, welcome to use it there. Just don't expect high priority to be given to
features which do not target scientific software development.
